# Youtube CeresFaunafy

Enhance your browsing experience with CeresFaunafy! Is your browser experience not natural enough? Are you having trouble finding your oshi? An absence of UUUUUUU in your life? Fear no more. This extension adds famous VTuber Ceres Fauna to every YouTube thumbnail.

This is a fork of [MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube), a fantastic extension which deserves all sorts of praise, I just modified it a tiny bit to be Fauna.

Instructions on how to port and modify the extension can be found [on MagicJinn's page](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/issues/16) or in "how-to-upload.txt".

Notes:
* This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with Ceres Fauna or YouTube.
* This is a work in progress, and more pictures will be added over time.
* I do my best to link the source of any art used in images/art-info.txt. Anyone whose art may be included who wants it removed, please feel free to reach out to me, and I will do just that. Additionally, I'm also accepting any Fauna screenshots that would work well as a thumbnail.
